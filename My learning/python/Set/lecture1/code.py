# SYNTAX OF SET:

# my_var = {1,2,3,4}

# print(my_var,"\n",type(my_var))

# SET THROUGH SET FUNCTION :

# anthor_set = set([10,20,30,40,50]) # this is another method to create a set through set function.
# print(anthor_set,"\n",type(anthor_set))

# empty_set = set()
# print(empty_set,"\n",type(empty_set))

# empty_set = set()

# print(empty_set,"\n",type(empty_set))

# HEADING OF SET 

# ORDERING OF THE SET:

# my_set = {7,6,3,4,2,5,1}

# print(my_set)

# No indexing in set are allowed:

# a = {"animal","ball","cat","dog"}

# print(a[0]) # it gives rise to error because it is not ordered one and connot be subscraptable okay

# NO DUPLICATES ARE ALLOWED IN SET:

# my_var = {10,20,14,10,23,22,14,23,22,98,10} # only unique element are 
# allowed in set means no duplicates can works in set. it will automatically ignore okay.

# print(my_var)

# ITERABLE :
# iteration is possible on set but the result will not be orderd vice .

# numeric = {10,20,30,40}

# for i in numeric:
#     print(i) # iteration in possiable in set .

#   HASHABLE ELEMENTS:

# my_set = {"a",[1,2,3,4,5],True, False, }
# print(my_set) # it wil rise to error because the list and dictionaries are not allowed in set. 

# x = {{"name":"waqas",
#       "age": 20},
#       {"occupaction":"Ai engineer"}
#       }
# print(x) # it rise to the error that set are not hashable and dictionary cannot be used in set okay


# empty_set = set([])
# print(empty_set,'\n',type(empty_set))
# anthor_set = set()
# print(anthor_set,'\n',type(anthor_set)) # these are the two different method of creating empty set
