# here we have to study operator in pyhton 
# The operator are that part on which other thangs can be made
# it forms logical condition in programming
# it create a stitution in programming 
# there a different type of operator like 
# 1) comparising operator
# 2) assignment operator
# 3) logical operator
# 4) Arthimetic operator
# lets code it

# Basic arthimetic operator
# a , b = 10 , 3

# print("Addition:" , a + b)
# print("Multiplication: ", a*b)
# print("Substration: ", a - b)
# print("Division: ", a/b)
# print("Floor Division: ",a //b)
# print("Modulus: ", a % b)
# print("Exponentation :", a**b)

# comparsion operator

x , y = 10 , 5

print("x > y: ", x > y)
print("x < y: ", x < y)
print("x >= y: ", x >= y)
print("x <= y: ", x <= y)
print("x != y: ", x != y)
print("x == y: ", x == y)
